Q1. Describe how you would increase Rookie Recruitment in 2025: 
A1. I would increase rookie recruitment by increasing interest via promotional material via Instagram or Youtube and increase Robotics Awareness. I would also attend the exact things that we usually do such as club fair and electoral fair. I would also increase ties with the Principal and get on the good side so the Principal could increase our funding and promotional materials.
