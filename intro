Hi I am Ren, you probably already know me but I am General Affairs/Defacto EE Lead of 1280. I am really just here for the fun of buiilding robots and going to comp. Matthew has mentioned to me that the team was doing a lot better back around 2015-2018ish years.
my goals is to bring the team back to it's former glory. Think of me as Otto Van Bismarck of 1280. I believe in reuniting and redefining roles with their dedicated members. My goal during this 2 year period is to go to worlds. "How do we do that?" well, 
we didn't put in our ods for this year unfortunately. We did not turn in the applications for First Impact and didn't do well for the irl showcase as we lacked pins and proper technical binder. Unfortunately that decreased our odds to go to worlds this year. 
Fortunaately if we showed up with a good robot and with good team morale(on paper) we could win awards, and the offseason projects I have in mind could help the team stand out to the judges while doing pit interview. With the electrical projects I have queued 
and the dedication of some members, we might be able to go to worlds by Awards. I also believe in collaberation with other teams, if I were to be elected as captain, my goal is also to maintain relations with teams from the Tri-valley schools, hoping I could 
talk to the leadership teacher, Mrs Wilford, to help me get in contact with other Robotics team in the Tri Valley area. This will help us with our Coopertition and Gracious Professionalism in our First Impact Awards writeup. 

Hope to see the team either/or under my lead!
