Thank you for considering time reading my documents. It has been a pleasure. I have some remarks on the documents but overall the team should benefit either with me as captain or me not as captain. I'm looking forward for more Outreach and defining the
leadership roles and hopefully I could finish my senior year with 2 blue banners under my belt. It has been a pleasure and I'm looking forward for the team's growth.
